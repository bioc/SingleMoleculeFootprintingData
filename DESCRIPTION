Description: This Data package contains data objcets relevanat 
    for the SingleMoleculeFootprinting package. More specifically, 
    it contains one example of aligned sequencing data (.bam & .bai) 
    necessary to run the SingleMoleculeFootprinting vignette. 
    Additionally, we provide data that are essential for some 
    functions to work correctly such as BaitCapture() and 
    SampleCorrelation().
